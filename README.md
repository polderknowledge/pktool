A tool to execute common development tasks such as creating new applications or libraries.

## Install

Download the following files:

- https://polderknowledge.github.io/pktool/pktool.phar
- https://polderknowledge.github.io/pktool/pktool.phar.pubkey

You will need to download both files, to the same directory, for the utility to work; additionally, the name of the 
key must not be changed. Once downloaded, make the the PHAR file executable.

**Pro-Tip:** Put both files in a directory that is on your $PATH. Than create the alias *pktool* to the phar so you 
can easily execute it from anywhere on your system.
